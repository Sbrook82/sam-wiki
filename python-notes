# Fundamentals
introductory concepts
python is an interpreted language: programs are executed by an interpreter
2 ways to use interpreter:
command-line mode
when you type python programs and the interpreter prints the results
script mode: a #script is a program stored in a file
when you write a program in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of that file
	that file is called a #script and files that contain python programs are .py files
important distinctions
function definition vs function call
Function definitions begin with the keyword def, so I simply tell my students, “When you define a function, begin with def, followed by the name of the function that you are defining; when you call a function, simply call (type) out its name.” 
#parameter vs #arguments
#parameters go with definitions
#arguments go with calls
debugging
syntax errors: an error in the syntax of a program that makes it impossible to parse
#syntax is the structure of a program
runtime errors: errors that don't appear until you run the program
AKA 'exceptions'
semantic errors: when the program can be executed, but does not do what you want it to
Variables, expressions, statements
values and types (intergers, strings)
types
str anything inside single quotation marks
int
float (numbers with a decimal point)
variables a variable is a name that refers to a value
variables must begin with a letter not a numeral
the assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values
ex.) >>> message = "What’s up, Doc?" 
>>> n = 17 >>> pi = 3.14159
statements: a statement is an instruction that the python interpreter can execute. a #script is a sequence of statements
the result of a print statement is a value
assignment statements don't produce a result
expressions: combination of values, variables, and operators
Operators & Operands
interger division: when both of the operands are intergers, the result must also be an interger
floating-point division
Mode
Including a mode argument is optional because a default value of ‘r’ will be assumed if it is omitted. The ‘r’ value stands for read mode, which is just one of many.
The modes are:
‘r’ – Read mode which is used when the file is only being read
‘w’ – Write mode which is used to edit and write new information to the file (any existing files with the same name will be erased when this mode is activated)
‘a’ – Appending mode, which is used to add new data to the end of the file; that is new information is automatically amended to the end
‘r+’ – Special read and write mode, which is used to handle both actions when working with a file
